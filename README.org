* =threejs-figwheel-main=

This is an update of the repo [[https://github.com/cassiel/threejs-figwheel][threejs-figwheel]] which has been left behind in the churn of Clojure[Script] tooling development. We have switched to [[https://figwheel.org/][Figwheel Main]]. We are still building with [[https://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]].

The example code brings up a minimal [[http://threejs.org/][three.js]] 3D animated environment coded in ClojureScript.

* Installation

We've followed the copious instructions [[https://figwheel.org/docs/installation.html][here]], opting for Leiningen rather than CLI Tools (mostly for familiarity).

* Running

In a terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  lein fig -- --build dev --repl
#+END_SRC

That brings up a terminal REPL and hot-reloading of files, and launches a browser window.

Or, for a full network REPL from emacs: =M-x cider-jack-in-cljs=, entering =figwheel-main= and =:dev= at the two prompts respectively.

If everything is working, there should be a simple non-lit tumbling cube animated in a full-window canvas.
